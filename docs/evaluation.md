Evaluation

Lightweight Strategies
- Golden sets: curated, versioned examples with expected outputs.
- Smoke checks: fast, cheap validation on each change.
- Metrics: task-appropriate automatic metrics with human spot-checks.

Prompting
- Save prompt templates alongside code.
- Record model, temperature, and seed where applicable.

Reproducibility
- Fix random seeds where supported; log runtime context.
